# ASCVD Service Helm Chart

## Introduction

This [Helm](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm) chart installs an instance of the [ASCVD](https://github.com/LinuxForHealth/health-analytics/tree/main/ascvd) service in a Kubernetes cluster.

## Pre-Requisites

- Kubernetes cluster 1.10+
- Helm 3.0.0+

## Installation

### Checkout the Code

Git clone this repository and `cd` into this directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LinuxForHealth/health-analytics.git
cd health-analytics/ascvd/chart/
```

### Install the Chart

Install the helm chart with a release name `ascvd`:

```bash
helm install ascvd .
```

This will install ASCVD, but it will not be exposed outside the cluster. To add an ingress for ASCVD, use:

```bash
helm install ascvd . --set ingress.enabled=true  --set ingress.class=<<INGRESS_CLASS>> --set ingress.subdomain=<<INGRESS_SUBDOMAIN>>
```

where `<<INGRESS_CLASS>>` is the ingress class used by your cloud environment, and `<<INGRESS_SUBDOMAIN>>` is the configured subdomain you wish to use for your ASCVD ingress.

### Using the Chart

See [ASCVD](../README.md) for information about calling the deployed API.

## Uninstallation

To uninstall/delete the `ascvd` deployment:

```bash
helm delete ascvd
```
